                The VARIAAIR Central System (VACS) from Becker provides a compact solution for supplying air to one or
                more
                production systems. This method of supplying suction and blast air supply is employed in a wide range of
                different places. Whether in small businesses or for specific stages of production in large companies,
                the
                energy-saving VARIAIR Central System delivers suction and blast air that's matched to demand.

            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                VACS cuts noise in the work environment and reduces operating personnel exposure to high temperatures
                through the
                absence of direct heat sources. This is where VACS offers the major advantage of Becker's modular
                control system
                VARIAIR Controller+. It manages as many as four different pressure levels with no more than seven pump
                units
                each. The VARIAair Central System obviates the need for additional pump rooms. Affording a high degree
                of
                flexibility, VACS uses short connection lines and costs little to install. All connected equipment is
                provided
                with a built-on frequency converter. Of modular design, these cabinets can be extended at any time to
                ensure
                flexibility in accommodating growing production requirements.
